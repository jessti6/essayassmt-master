Insulin	Insulin glargine is an agonist of...	...the insulin receptor [IR] which is located on liver cells [and skeletal muscle cells and adipocytes].	Normally, the IR responds to the hormone insulin to upregulate expression of glucose transporters [GLUT4] and glycogen biosynthetic enzymes.	Insulin glargine also activates IR, thereby [lowering blood glucose and] decreasing the hyperglycemia the is characteristic of diabetes.
